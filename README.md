# Stock Prediction and Forecasting Python Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Python project for predicting and forecasting stock prices. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future stock prices. Additionally, there is a Streamlit application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the stock prediction model.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **`src` Directory:**
   - `stock_prediction.py`: Python script containing the core logic for training the stock prediction model. It uses historical stock data to make predictions about future stock prices.
   - `data_preprocessing.py`: Python script for preprocessing the historical stock data before feeding it into the prediction model.

2. **`streamlit_app` Directory:**
   - `app.py`: Streamlit application code for creating a web-based interface to interact with the stock prediction model. Users can input stock data and visualize predictions.

3. **`requirements.txt`:**
   - Lists all the dependencies required to run the project. Use the following command to install them:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **`README.md`:**
   - You are currently reading the README file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the stock prediction project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction.git
   cd stock-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the stock prediction model:
   ```bash
   python src/stock_prediction.py
   ```

4. Explore the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Streamlit app.
